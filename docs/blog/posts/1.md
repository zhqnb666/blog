## Title2

??? info "Use cases for the projects plugin"

    Ideal use cases for the projects plugin are:

    - Building a multi-language site
    - Building a blog alongside your documentation
    - Splitting large code bases for better performance

    Note that the plugin is currently experimental. We're releasing it early,
    so that we can improve it together with our users and make it even more
    powerful as we discover new use cases.
